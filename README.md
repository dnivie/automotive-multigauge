# arduino based multigauge
## Due to aftermarket autogauges being so expensive and cluttering up your view, I decided to make my own gauges and displaying them on only one screen. Saving hundreds of dollars and making my interior look a lot cleaner.

## This project is considered finished. See my Electronic Boost Controller repo for new project which shares lots of code with this project.
